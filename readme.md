# Matza Time

Matza Time allows people to share recipes that include matza as an ingredient. It also allows users to post comments on recipes. Matza, which can also be referred to as “matzo” and “matzah,” is eaten during the holiday of Passover in the Jewish religion. I decided to make it because this project was assigned during the week of Passover and I knew that some of my friends and family members would be making some delicious food items with matza.

## Next steps:

In the future I would like it so a user can delete and update their comments. I want the matza recipes on the landing page to be organized by date, with newest one added to the top. I would also like to polish the css and have it be mobile friendly. In addition, I want the user to be able to upload a file directly onto the site instead of having to convert the image to a string before uploading it.
